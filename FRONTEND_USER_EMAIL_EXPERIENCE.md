# 📧 How Frontend Users Will Receive Emails

## When Users Register from Your Flutter App

### Step 1: User Enters Email
```
User types: john.doe@gmail.com
Flutter app calls: POST /api/auth/send-verification-email
```

### Step 2: Backend Sends Verification Email
Your Laravel backend will:
1. Generate 6-digit code (e.g., `847392`)
2. Save to database with 10-minute expiry
3. Send beautiful email to `john.doe@gmail.com`

### Step 3: User Receives Email
The user will get this email in their inbox:

```
From: Nutrifarm <noreply@nutrifarm.com>
Subject: 🌱 Your Nutrifarm Verification Code

[Beautiful HTML email with:]
- Nutrifarm logo and branding
- Large verification code: 847392
- Instructions to enter in app
- 10-minute expiry warning
- Professional footer
```

### Step 4: User Enters Code in App
```
User types: 847392
Flutter app calls: POST /api/auth/verify-email-code
Backend validates and allows registration
```
