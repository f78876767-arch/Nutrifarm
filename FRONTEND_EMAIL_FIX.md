# ðŸ”§ Frontend Email Issue - SOLVED!

## The Problem
Your frontend is calling `/api/send-verification-email` (old endpoint) which has syntax errors, instead of `/api/auth/send-verification-email` (new working endpoint).

## Quick Fix Options

### Option 1: Update Frontend (Recommended)
Change your frontend API call from:
```
POST /api/send-verification-email
```
To:
```
POST /api/auth/send-verification-email
```

### Option 2: Test Both Endpoints

**Working Endpoint (New):**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/auth/send-verification-email \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "kevstorm99@gmail.com"}'
```

**Response:** âœ… `{"success":true,"message":"Verification code sent to your email"}`

## Why This Happened
1. You had two verification email endpoints
2. The old one (`/api/send-verification-email`) expected frontend to generate codes
3. The new one (`/api/auth/send-verification-email`) auto-generates codes
4. Your frontend is using the old broken endpoint

## What to Tell Your Frontend Team

**Use this endpoint for sending verification emails:**
```
POST /api/auth/send-verification-email

Request Body:
{
    "email": "user@example.com"
}

Success Response:
{
    "success": true,
    "message": "Verification code sent to your email",
    "expires_in_minutes": 10
}
```

**Complete Working Flow:**
1. `POST /api/auth/send-verification-email` - Send code
2. `POST /api/auth/verify-email-code` - Verify code  
3. `POST /api/auth/register-with-email-verification` - Complete registration
4. `POST /api/auth/login` - Login with credentials

## Test It Now
Run this command to test the working endpoint:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/auth/send-verification-email \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "your-email@gmail.com"}'
```

You should receive a verification email immediately! ðŸ“§âœ¨

**Your email system is working perfectly - just need to use the right endpoint!** ðŸš€
